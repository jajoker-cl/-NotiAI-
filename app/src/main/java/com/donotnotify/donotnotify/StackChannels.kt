/**
 * One notification channel per STACK rule, so the user can set sound/vibration per rule in
 * Android's settings. Stacking otherwise flattens every re-posted notification onto a single
 * channel, discarding whatever alerting the source app's own channel had.
 *
 * Android only lets the *user* change a channel's importance/sound/vibration once it exists —
 * the app can only choose the values at creation. So this file's job is limited to: minting the
 * right channels, naming them intelligibly, seeding them sensibly on migration, and deleting
 * them when their rule goes away. Everything after that belongs to the user.
 *
 * The decisions are a pure function ([planChannelSync]) over an Android-free [ChannelHost] seam,
 * matching the `planAbsorb`/`StackPoster` split already used by [StackedNotificationManager], so
 * the invariants below are unit-testable on the JVM.
